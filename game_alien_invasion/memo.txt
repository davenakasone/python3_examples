"""
not good unless you run from computer
try pasting main file 'alien_invasion.py' here 
the pygame library is massive and you can check to see when new things come out
"""

This is supposed to let the player control a rocketship on the bottom of the screen and shoot aliens
The player can move right and left with the arrow keys
Aliens that make it to bottom or shoot the ship cause a life (ship) to be lost
The player only gets 3 lives, game ends once 3 deaths occur
If the player shoots all the aliens, more aliens that move faster than the last group come

you'll want the pip module
MacBook-Pro-2:~ davidnakasone$ python3 -m pip install --user pygame
or
MacBook-Pro-2:alien_invasion davidnakasone$ python3 -m pip install -U pygame==2.0.0.dev6 --user
it tells python to run the pip module and install pygame package to the current user's python installation

see computer for working files

.bmp is best, bitmaps are loaded by pygame (default)
use a transparent or solid background that can be easily replaced
